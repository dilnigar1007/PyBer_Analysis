# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to see the trend for the total fares by different city type between Jan 2019 and May 2019. For this analysis, we have combined city data and rider information data, merged together to create a complete pyber dataset based on the city name. The new pyber dataset provided all the information that we needed to continue this analysis.

## Results
![summary dataframe](https://github.com/dilnigar1007/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/summary.png)
Based on the summary chart above, we have the highest number of rides in urban areas, and the lowest number of rides in rural areas. The trend is also the same for the number of drivers. We have the most drivers in the urbans and the least in rural. Due to the high number of rides and drivers in urban areas, total amount of fares collected is the highest in urban. But, since each city type has different fare price, rural turns out to have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This lowers from rural to suburban to urban. So, urban has the lowest avg. fare for both ride and drivers even though it has the biggest number of drivers and rides.

These trend lines clearly show that urban has the highest total fare comparing to the other two. 

## Summary
Because we have so many rides in urban areas, one of the recommendations to the CEO is to increase the fare price in this area so the revenue can go up. Also, the number of drivers in urban areas are too high, this might be causing the average fare to be lower than what it supposed to be. Cutting the drivers might be one of the solutions, it might help increase the average fare per driver.
